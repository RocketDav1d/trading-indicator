# trading-indicator-rsi 📈

A small data science project for my lemon.markets🍋 application (got accepted!)

It gathers data using the lemon.markets API and calculates the RSI (relative strenghts index)

The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. 
RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security.
